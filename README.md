# k8s-scale-test

An AI-augmented Kubernetes scale testing framework that finds infrastructure bugs you didn't know you had.

k8s-scale-test pushes EKS clusters to their limits, monitors every signal the cluster emits, and uses a multi-layer investigation pipeline to automatically diagnose failures in real time. When something breaks at scale — a VPC CNI race condition, a subnet running out of IPs, Karpenter hitting an EC2 capacity wall — the tool traces the problem from symptom to root cause without human intervention.

What makes this different from load generators: the tool doesn't just create pods and measure latency. It connects three AWS MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers — Prometheus, CloudWatch, and EKS — into a unified observability fabric that an AI agent can query during a live test. The Prometheus MCP server provides fleet-wide metrics via PromQL. The CloudWatch MCP server surfaces node-level error patterns from dataplane logs. The EKS MCP server exposes cluster state, pod events, and control plane health. Together, they give the AI agent the same investigative reach as an SRE with full console access — but operating at machine speed across hundreds of nodes simultaneously.

The result: bugs that would take hours of manual log correlation to find — like the [VPC CNI netlink dump interruption](docs/bug-report-vpc-cni-mac-collision.md) that silently fails 10-19% of pod creations at high density — get surfaced, diagnosed, and documented automatically during the test run.

Built for validating EKS infrastructure at scale: node autoscaling (Karpenter), VPC CNI/IPAMD, scheduler throughput, container runtime performance, and the interactions between them that only break under real production-like load.

## How It Works

The test controller follows a GitOps workflow via Flux:

1. **Preflight** validates cluster capacity (subnet IPs, vCPU quota, NodePool limits, pod ceiling) and checks observability connectivity (AMP, CloudWatch, EKS API)
2. **Infrastructure scaling** deploys iperf3 servers first, waits for them to be ready
3. **Stressor scaling** distributes target pods across cpu-stress, memory-stress, io-stress, iperf3-client, and sysctl-connection-test deployments by committing replica counts to the Flux repo
4. **CL2 preload** runs ClusterLoader2 concurrently to create additional K8s objects (namespaces, deployments, services, configmaps, secrets) proportional to the target pod count
5. **Monitoring** tracks pod ready rate via K8s deployment watch API, with an independent observer using the pod list API for cross-validation
6. **Anomaly detection** investigates rate drops and pending timeouts by collecting K8s events, pod phase breakdowns, node diagnostics via SSM, and ENI state
7. **Hold at peak** runs a node health sweep, checks Karpenter resource usage
8. **Cleanup** scales all deployments to 0, deletes CL2 namespaces, drains nodes

## Monitoring & Observability

The test controller has two independent monitoring paths:

- **Monitor** (deployment watch API) — tracks `readyReplicas` from deployment status updates in real time, computes rolling average ready rate, fires alerts on rate drops
- **Observer** (pod list API) — polls actual Running pod count every 10s as an independent cross-check, catches deployment controller lag or watch disconnects

### MCP Server Integration

For AI-assisted investigation during scale tests, the tool integrates with three AWS MCP servers:

| MCP Server | Purpose | What It Provides |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| `awslabs.prometheus-mcp-server` | Fleet-wide metrics | Node CPU/memory, pod counts, Karpenter metrics via PromQL |
| `awslabs.cloudwatch-mcp-server` | Node-level logs | Kubelet, containerd, IPAMD, kube-proxy logs via Logs Insights |
| `awslabs.eks-mcp-server` | Cluster state | Node conditions, pod events, EKS insights |

See [docs/mcp-setup.md](docs/mcp-setup.md) for configuration details.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
python3 -m pytest tests/ --cov=k8s_scale_test --cov-report=term-missing
```

The test suite includes property-based tests via Hypothesis for the preflight capacity calculations and CL2 parser.
